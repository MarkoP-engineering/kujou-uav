- The wingspan of the airplane will be approximately 1.8 to 1.9m in order to provide the necessary lift and handling capabilities. 
- The Fuselage will be printed out of PLA-LW with 4% infill and 1-2 walls. The approximate weight comes out to about 180g. It will be reinforced with carbon fiber strips that should provide stiffness to the brittle PLA.
- The wing will use the Epler 205 airfoil due to it's good efficiency, as it is mostly used in gliders and thermal soaring airplanes, thus being perfect for my application.
  As for the internal structure of the wing, I have two options:
  -The option of going with a carbon tube for each wing, simplifying the interna structure
    Disadvantages: Since long carbon tubes are expensive - it will add at least 10-20% to the overall project price. the need for extra deisgn of the wing for aerodynamic stability, since I will not be able to just use the V shape.
    Advantages: Simple internal structure - easy to deisgn and print
  -The option to go with "ribs" and an internal "I"-beam shaped profile, created by two thin carbon fiber rods glud to a vertical section of the wing with 100% infill.
    Disadvantages: Simple to design internal structure. The need for ribs means the print will be done in more parts than with the tube deisgn, introducing the need fo more glueing.
    Advantages: Significantly cheaper - thin carbon rods are way cheaper than tubes. Easier to design the wing surface - I can just use the V shape for passive stability.
Currently I am leaning towards the "I" beam inspired design mainly due to it's cost. The impact of adding ribs to the model will be approximately 100 to 150g, which is acceptable.
- I chose to go with a V-tail configuration, mainly for weight and drag reduction. I am yet to choose between the standard and inverted v tail. Will the inverted protect from prop strikes?
- The plane will most likely be a pusher configuration. Tractor configuration should provide increased efficiency, but will obstruct the view of any cameras or sensor I decide to put on the airplane.
- I will fly the airplane with and FPV system and switch to autopilot later, once flight testing has concluded and the plane is stable and reliable.
Next I need to design a way to mount the wing to the fuselage and the motor mount. The design of the V tail should also be started on.
