Wing:

Split the wing into 8 segments, 4 per each half. Each one is 220 mm in heigh.. Changed the airfoil to Epler 205. 

The segments include:
- Wing-mounting-segment - the segment that will be closest to the body. Has a hole in it to insert a metal spar that will connect the two halves of the wing together.
- Wing-standard-segment - the standard segment. 4 of these will have to be printed. One will go between the aileron and the mounting segment and the other will be on the tip.
- Wing-aileron-segment - the segment containing the aileron. Intended to print in one piece with the whole wing. Includes special print modifier for hte hinge part.

I also modeled special modifier to be used inside of slicing software to change settings like infil percentage and wall count in places where it is needed.

The modifiers include:
- Modifier-ribs - this modifier is applied to every segment and should be set to 25% triangle infil, 1 wall, no top and bottomm layers. This should create ribs printable throughout the wing without the use of solid layers.
- Modifier-I-profile - this modifier is applied to every segment and should create the I-beam profile inside the wing that will lie in between the carbon spars. It should be set to 100% infil.
- Modifier-wing-aileron - this modifier is applied only to the aileron segment, and should add extra structure around the hinge area. It should be set to 3 walls.

The wing shape has been altered to add space for a wooden spar that will run along the whole length of the wing and should further reinforce the structure. 

The dimensions of hardware (carbon rods, wooden spar) are still subject to change, so this design is not yet usable as is.

The overall estimated eight of the wing so far should be around 450 - 500 g when printed out of lightweight PLA (assuming density of 0.55g/mm3)

Next I intend to create a mechanism for joining the wing segments together and finalize the sizes for hardware.

The spar that will connect the wings together and to the fuselage will be made of steel with dimensions of 2 by 12 by 120 mm. I may also cut it in a v shape to make the wings into a V shape and grant extra stability.

The hole for the spar is very approximate, and will be finalised when the spar is manufactured. This is due to it being a very manual and imprecise process. I intend to look into alternatives/more precises ways of manufacturing.

I currently intend to drill holes into the metal spar for screws, via which the wing will be connected to the fuselage.
