These are the files intended for 3D printing. The STEP files are the ones that can actually be modified. 
The normal files should be inserted into the slicer normally. 
The files labeled "modifier" should be inserted via the "load modifier" function. This should be done before any orientation/position changes have been made to the standard file to assure correct alignment. 
Then, settings should be set up as instructed for each of the modifiers and the main body, which will apply everywhere except the places where the modifiers touch the model.
