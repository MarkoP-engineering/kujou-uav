# kujou-uav
The goal of this project is to develop a long range capable 3D printed UAV. 
## Requirements: 
- As many 3d printed parts as possible
- Cheap and easy to build
- Versatile testing and development platform
- Durable and simple to operate
## Project goals
- At least 500g cargo capacity
- At least 30km range
- At least 50kmh speed
- Max 2m wingspan for easy transport
- Max 2kg weight for operation safety
## Learning goals
- Learn more about structural deisgn for airplanes
- Study aerodynamics and airfoils to better understand aricraft performance, handling and efficiency
- Improve CAD skills, mainly with 3d modelling and possibly PCB design
- Learn programming to later create my own autopilot software


PS. This is my first time working with github by myself, so everything might not be up to standard just yet
