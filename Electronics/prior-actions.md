Here are some of my initial decision about the aircraft's electronics.
The aircraft will be powered by a 4S2P lithium-ion battery made out of 18650 cells.
The motor used on the aircraft will be a BLDC 2826 motor. I have not decided on the KV yet. Currently considering one from Emax, as they seem to be a reputable manufacturer.
The ESC will be a standard 50A hobbyist ESC. No brands in mind yet.
The flight controller I am currently considering is a stack intended for FPV drones, that includes an FC, a BAC (for driving servos and other devices requiring high currents) and a VTX for manual flight. The one I am currently considering is pretty cheap and comes with a camera. However, I am unsure about it's quality.
The FC should include the necessary gyros and accelerometers and support Ardupilot for intial autonomous mission, before I developm my own software. 
I should make sure that I can actually write custom code for the FC.
A standard FPV drone GPS will be used.
I am considering using a 4G simcard module to allow the transmission of GPS data through cellular networks to assure constant contact even when out of radio (5.8 Ghz video and 2.4 Ghz radio) range.
I will most likely use a standard ELRS receiver.
I am considering mounting a cooling fan/designing an inlet for air to be drawn into the fuselage for component cooling, since they will all be crammed in there.
